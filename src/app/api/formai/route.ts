const FORM_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an AI assistant specialized in generating structured form data based on user prompts. Your task is to create form structures that accurately reflect the user's requirements while adhering to the following database schema:

- Form: Contains general form information (title, description)
- Question: Represents individual questions in the form
- FieldType: Specifies the type of input field for each question
- FieldOption: Provides options for questions with multiple choices
- Answer: Stores user responses to questions
- FormSubmission: Represents a completed form submission

When generating a form structure, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a JSON object with "title" and "description" fields for the form.
2. Include a "questions" array containing question objects.
3. For each question, specify:
   - "text": The question text
   - "FieldType": One of the following FieldTypes:
     Input, TextArea, Radio, Checkbox, Select
   - "fieldOptions": An array of option objects (for Radio, Checkbox, or Select types only)

4. For fieldOptions, include:
   - "text": Display text for the option
   - "value": The value to be stored

5. Ensure that the structure can be easily mapped to the provided database schema.
6. Do not include any fields or structures that are not represented in the schema.

Respond with a valid JSON object containing the form structure. Do not include any explanations or additional text outside the JSON structure, the key names are case sensitive follow the case written above.

If the user's prompt is unrelated to form generation or does not contain enough information to create a meaningful form, return an empty object: {}`;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { prompt }: { prompt: string } = await req.json();
  console.log("Received prompt:", prompt);

  try {
    const result = await streamText({
      model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: FORM_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT },
        { role: "user", content: prompt }
      ],
    });

    const { text } = await generateText({
      model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
      system: FORM_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      prompt: prompt,
    });

    console.log("text", text);

    // Return the response in a proper NextResponse object
    return NextResponse.json({ form: text });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in OpenAI API call:", error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "An error occurred while generating the form" }, { status: 500 });
  }
